# Rock-Paper-Scissors
A rock paper scissors CLI application made from C#

# How to play
I have only included the .cs file in here so if you would like to play it, create a dotnet application and just copy that file and place it into that folder that has been created when you make the dotnet applications. Delete the "Program.cs" file and in the command line, run "dotnet run."

NOTE: you can only play this if you have dotnet installed, if you don't, click on: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download

# another thing to keep in mind
uhh if you must know, I uhh kinda overdid this project. I literally added 2 gamemodes, an option where you can write your name out and play, colors to the console and some delays to give that sarcastic effect. That's why its 300 lines of code lmao.
